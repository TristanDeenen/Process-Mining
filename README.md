Logfile.py is the implementation for the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), created by Stephen Pauwels.

Overview.ipynb creates the state transition diagram, using pm4py. Via Disco, the visualisation has been trimmed externally, such that redundant information does not obscure the graph anymore.

Added columns.ipynb is the first attempt at adding columns for the actual and predicted next events for the baseline. Code generally does not contain comments and is not parameterized.

Cleaned Code.ipynb is generally the same as Added columns.ipynb, but now the code is more readable and parameterized.

test.ipynb is used to test whether the code in the two files mentioned above works as intended.
